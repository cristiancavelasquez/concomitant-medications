# Concomitant Medications
The main purpose of this project is to elaborate a Python script and a Power Bi dashboard in order to identify the most prescribed concomitant products in a pharmacy chain.

## Context 

The company where this project was developed is a data analysis firm specializing in the pharmaceutical sector. The suppliers of that firm (pharmacy chains) play a crucial role in the development of its economic activities. It is for this reason that significant daily efforts are made with the purpose of retaining these suppliers.

A few weeks ago, one of the largest suppliers of the company decided not to continue their partnership because the competition was offering them more favorable terms. This raised concerns among the company's executives, and I was assigned the responsibility of creating a project that could be presented to the supplier with the aim of retaining their business with us. 
>[!IMPORTANT]
> As context, this supplier holds the largest market share in my country (Colombia) and also has a presence in other Latin American countries.

Having prior knowledge of the information available to the company, I decided to create a dashboard that would enable the supplier to identify the best-selling products and their concomitant products. A concomitant product is one or more products that are typically prescribed together within a medical prescription. For example, if you visit a doctor for an infection, you will be prescribed a medication for the infection and one or two more to address the side effects that the initial product may cause.

This concomitance report is of significant importance to the supplier, as it allows them to determine, based on their best-selling products, which items they should keep in stock to avoid missing out on sales of concomitant products.
